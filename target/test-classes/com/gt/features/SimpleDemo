Feature: Zero Bank - Purchase foreign currency cash
  
  In order to purchase foreign currency
  As a valid customer of Zero Bank
  I want to have a feature to purchase different types of currencies
  
  Scenario: Calculate conversion cost from USD to GBP
  Given I am in the Purchase Foreign Currency page
  And I select the currency type as "Great Britain (pound)"
  When I try to calculate the conversion cost for "100 USD"
  Then I should be displayed with the conversion amount with "Great Britain (pound)"
